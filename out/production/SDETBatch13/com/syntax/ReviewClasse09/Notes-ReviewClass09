OOPS is just a way of writing code a methodology a set of rules that we
follow when we write code.In this methodology we create classes and objects
of those classes to represent everything from real life.
we also have:
1) functional programming
2) procedural programming

Four Pillars of OOPS:
    1)Inheritance
    2)Polymorphism
    3)Abstraction
    4)Encapsulation

Some Benefits of OOPS:
1)Code re-usability
2)Cleaner code
3)More flexibility
4)Less code
5)Enforcing rules and hiding the complexity and only focusing on the ideas
6)Secure code

1)Inheritance:
 This is a mechanism in java through which a class can acquire the properties(Attributes/fields)
 and methods of another classes.

 Why should we use inheritance:
  If a piece of code is already present in a class instead of re writing it
  or copying it we can extend our class from that class and we will get all the
  non-private methods and fields from that class.it can save a lot of time.Its
  also good for performance reasons.
Disadvantages of Inheritance:
  1)we get the unwanted code as well when we inherit from a class.
  2)Classes are tightly coupled which means if we change something in the parent
  class it affects all the child classes.

How can we use inheritance:
  we use the extends keyword to inherit the classes

 class parent{
 String name;

 void printName(){
 }
 }
 class child extends parent{
 }

Rules:
 1)Inheritance is one way from parent to child only.
 2)Inheritance in java we can't inherit from multiple classes.
 3)Final classes can't be inherited.classes which are declared with final keyword
 are called final classes.
 4)Private members(fields and methods) are not inherited.
 5)Constructors are not inherited but we can call them using super() keyword.
 6)Child classes must provide a matching constructor.

Types of inheritance:
 1)Single inheritance.
 2)Multilevel inheritance.
 3)Hierarchical inheritance.
 4)Multiple inheritance(Not supported in java).

Single inheritance:
 Only one parent and on child class.
